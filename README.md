## Overview

The goal of this project is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go.

## My dataset

My dataset contains an aggregate statistics of all the NBA players during the 67 seasons between 1950 to 2017.

It's a big data set that contains a lot of statistics such as:

- Season
- Team
- Player name
- Position
- Points
- Field Goal Percentage


Data scraped from:
https://www.basketball-reference.com

## Goals

I have some ideas because of the size of the dataset:

- Comparisons between two important players, like Lebron and Jordan year by year. Who will be better analyzing the data.

- Compare one historic player with a Rookie player (Kobe Bryant vs. Luka Doncic) in his first year as a professional player.

- Do an evolutionary study of one general statistic by position. For example: Points per position or rebounds per position.

- Do an evolutionary study of the shooting improvement about one player.

- Do the same evolutionary study but about one general statistic. For example: the shot of three or the free throws.

In these days, I will decide what type of visualization do and what 'sub-dataset' choose.


## Conclusions

Basketball in general, seems to be less hard if we make a shot about 2,3 meters or under the rim. It's more risky, but out of the zone and out of the zone of 2 points, obviously, game seems more difficult, but our reward is higher.

With a dataset like this, we learn a lot about make new statistics, graphs, scatter plots and more and above all we learnt about all of this data that exists, under each NBA player whereby we can establish the value of each player inside a NBA Franchise.
