# Project: Visualizing Real World Data

## Overview

The goal of this project is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go.

## My dataset

My dataset contains an aggregate statistics of all the NBA players during the 67 seasons between 1950 to 2017.

It's a big data set that contains a lot of statistics such as:

- Season
- Team
- Player name
- Position
- Points
- Field Goal Percentage


Data scraped from:
https://www.basketball-reference.com

## Goals

I have some ideas because of the size of the dataset:

- Comparisons between two important players, like Lebron and Jordan year by year. Who will be better analyzing the data.

- Compare one historic player with a Rookie player (Kobe Bryant vs. Luka Doncic) in his first year as a professional player.

- Do an evolutionary study of one general statistic by position. For example: Points per position or rebounds per position.

- Do an evolutionary study of the shooting improvement about one player.

- Do the same evolutionary study but about one general statistic. For example: the shot of three or the free throws.

In these days, I will decide what type of visualization do and what 'sub-dataset' choose.


## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

 - Select a dataset from a public source.
 - Create a Jupyter notebook to analyze the data
 - Using your data, create a minimum of one scatter plot, one histogram, one box plot and one bar graph (you can add more than one visualization of each type of you choose). Graphs should contain the proper labeling of the x and y axis when appropriate as well as a title for the graph.
 - Explain what insight or information is inferred from these visualizations. The explanation should be in the notebook in markdown cells.
